# pystars
A simple two-player tic-tac-toe like game, built with pygame.

Players take turns placing their tokens on the board. Once a token is on the board, it may only be moved to an unoccupied adjacent star. The game is won when one player gets three tokens in a row: the center slot, plus any two nodes on opposite sides of the octagon.

There is no play-against-machine option yet.
